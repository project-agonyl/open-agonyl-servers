# Active Context

## Current Focus: Zone Server Implementation

### Immediate Goals
1. **Complete Zone Server Foundation**: Build the core zone server following established patterns
2. **Database Integration**: Implement sqlx and squirrel-based database operations
3. **TCP Server Implementation**: Create custom protocol server for zone server
4. **World Simulation**: Implement 256x256 grid-based world simulation
5. **Player Management**: Handle player connections, movement, and state updates

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Database Layer
- **No ORM**: Using sqlx for direct SQL operations
- **Query Building**: Squirrel for type-safe query construction
- **Connection Pooling**: Leveraging sqlx built-in connection pooling
- **Manual Mapping**: Direct struct mapping without ORM overhead

#### Architecture Patterns
- **Follow Established Patterns**: Reuse TCP server patterns from other servers
- **Spatial System**: Implement 9-tile broadcasting for efficient updates
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous event processing for game mechanics
- **State Management**: Efficient player and NPC state tracking

#### Performance Considerations
- **Grid-Based World**: 256x256 cell maps with efficient spatial queries
- **Concurrent Processing**: Goroutine-based packet and simulation handling
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal allocations in hot paths
- **Connection Optimization**: TCP_NODELAY for low latency
