### Known Issues

#### **Technical Debt**
- Zone server needs core data structures
- Game protocol handlers incomplete
- Spatial system not implemented
- Binary file loading not integrated

#### **Architecture Considerations**
- Need to define world simulation boundaries
- Spatial partitioning strategy needs implementation
- Memory management for large player counts
- Network optimization for real-time updates

### Risk Assessment

#### **High Risk**
- Zone server core functionality incomplete
- Game mechanics not implemented
- Performance under load unknown

#### **Medium Risk**
- Integration complexity between servers
- Data consistency across distributed system
- Security vulnerabilities in game protocol

#### **Low Risk**
- Documentation gaps
- Testing coverage
- Deployment automation

### Recommendations

### Overall Assessment

The project has a solid foundation with 5 out of 6 servers fully implemented. The zone server is the final critical component and is 60% complete in its foundation phase. The main blockers are core data structures and game protocol implementation. Once these are completed, the system will have all essential components for a functional MMO game server.
